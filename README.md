# Two-Week Temperature Analysis in Pasay City
This project focuses on utilizing Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques to measure temperature and subsequently creating data visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to capture temperature data, process it using DSP methods, and present meaningful visualizations for better understanding and analysis.

*### Abstract*
*This project delves into the investigation of
temperature patterns within Pasay City, spanning from October
17 to October 31, 2023. An assortment of theories and
methodologies has been employed to facilitate a comprehensive
analysis of this dataset. Utilizing the straightforward
connectivity of an ESP32 module, temperature data was
meticulously collected and systematically stored within a Google
spreadsheet, offering a robust dataset for examination. In an
effort to enhance comprehension of temperature behavior, the
research team has meticulously crafted graphical
representations, including amplitude-frequency waveforms and
temperature-time histograms. These visualizations are pivotal in
providing insights into the variations and trends within the
temperature data, thus contributing to a more comprehensive
understanding of the environmental conditions during this
specific time frame.*
